### Staff Tasks and Roles (STAR) Classification Code

This code takes as input a list of job titles from the [UMETRICS dataset](https://iris.isr.umich.edu/research-data/) and sorts them into 21 categories of non-academic research jobs (ie. student, postdoctoral, or faculty). The code relies on the UMETRICS systematic occupational classification to treat academic job titles. 

Detailed information on the development and implementation of the classification can be found in the methods document at [https://doi.org/10.21987/j69s-2t47].
